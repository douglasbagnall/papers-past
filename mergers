# This file contains rules to merge books together (perhaps because
# they are too short to stand on their own, or they belong together
# conceptually, like the cyclopedia volumes, or both).
#
# Lines beginning with "#" are ignored. Each cluster of non-blank
# lines defines a target book. The first line of the cluster ends with
# a colon, and everything before it is the identifier for the new
# book. The following lines list the identifiers of the contributing
# books, which can be separated by multiple spaces or single
# new-lines.
